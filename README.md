    SE300 Profile Notes
--------------------------

SE300 TPU 070nozzle Sain Smart 85A-95A durometer

Use a machine profile with extruder for 0.7mm dia nozzle. This profile is specifically made for spiral vase printing quickly. No bottom, no top layers, only outside perimeter. The 0.7mm nozzle prints nicer due to lower back pressure and provides a thicker sturdy wall. We use this printing our boots for the hotend whip.
